Project: Program 2 - Pointers and Bits

Installations: C Compiler

The project contains two sections

Part 1: String Manipulations : Implemented a mystrstr function which will match the needle string’s presence in haystack string and return 1 if true.

Part 2: Bits and Bytes : In this we have a function which will count the number of 1’s after converting it to binary.

We have another function which will store the binary number in an array and last

we have a function which will print the binary number from the array.

- Binary logic has been adapted from 
https://codeforwin.org/2016/01/c-program-to-convert-decimal-to-binary-number-system-using-bitwise-operator.html
and has been implemented with my understanding.

Running the tests:
Using a vim editor and commands.
Compiling the mylib.h file – gcc mylib.h
Compiling the program2.c file – gcc ngupta_program2.c
Running the program2.c - ./a.out

ngupta4_program2.c have a elaborate set of tests which are running to check the efficiency of the functions written in mylib.h
